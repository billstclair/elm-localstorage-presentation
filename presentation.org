This is an Emacs Org Mode buffer. Many features will be missing if you don't have Emacs.

* Setup

To be done before the presentation.

cd ~/elm-localstorage/example
elm reactor

Open a new window in Chrome. Hide the others.
Make Chrome the default browser.
Make the default font bigger.

* Intro

You often need to have persistent state for your Elm apps. I've found the easiest way to do this is with the JavaScript [[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html#storage-2][localStorage]] facility.

+ localStorage.getItem(<name>)
+ localStorage.setItem(<name>, <value>)
+ localStorage.removeItem(<name>)
+ localStorage.length
+ localStorage.key(<index>)
+ localStorage.clear()

localStorage provides a persistent key/value store for strings, with a separate database for each domain.

* billstclair/elm-localstorage

[[http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/billstclair/elm-localstorage/latest][billstclair/elm-localstorage]] provides a simple port-based interface from Elm to JS localStorage. There is a pure-Elm, Dict-based version that you can use in elm-reactor, and a tiny JS file that you can attach to your index.html file for real persistence.

Peruse docs for LocalStorage and LocalStorage.SharedTypes.
